# React Router Portfolio Refactor

Using the project from the previous day, refactor your components to encompass the knowledge from today's lessons.

## Getting Started

- To get started you will need open to up your Portfolio Application from yesterday's assignment.

- You should still have the following separate components (you will add two more later in the project):

  - App.js
  - BaseLayout.js
  - Home.js
  - About.js
  - Portfolio.js

- Your navigation bar should be fully functional and allow the users to navigate seamlessly through your app. The back button in the browser should take user's to the previous screen (because of the history API and using <BrowserRouter>).

- You will need to migrate your <BaseLayout> component into your index.js file and apply it in the appropriate position so that it will render on each page.

- You will no longer need to import your BaseLayout component to any other component once you have achieved the proper migration into the ReactDOM.render method.

- Replace the <Link> components in your BaseLayout component with <NavLink> components and apply your own styling to differentiate them when they are active (see HINTS).

- Use exact path to render your splash index page (your App.js component).

- Create two more components - a Contact.js component and a References.js component.

  - Contacts should render a page with mock contact information.
  - Contacts should have links to an email, Facebook, GitHub, Phone, etc. (these can be mock or your own).
  - References should render a list of 3-5 references from past mock employers.
  - Each "reference" should include a name, contact info, and lorem ipsum (or mock recommendations if you are inclined) as their recommendations.

- Add a two more <NavLink>'s to your navigation bar in your <BaseLayout> and create content for them.

  - Add a link to Contact.
  - Add a link to References.

- The final project should still be an attractive mock portfolio website. The content and styling are up to you. See example down below for a general idea of simple project structure, though your project should be more professional and polished! Don't forget about CSS frameworks like Bootstrap to help you out!

## Hints

- Remember that you can create a component that receives other components using {props.children} or {this.props.children} depending upon it being a class based component or a functional component.

- Don't forget activeClassName!

## Results

Once complete, your project should have the following functionality but should be more professionally styled.
